Welcome to my Github Profile!
----------------------

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In my doctoral research, I explore the dependency on fuelwood from community forests in Nepal and assess household energy transition in rural Nepal. Additionally, I investigate the impacts of indoor air pollution from fuelwood use on women’s and children’s health. I earned a B.Sc. in Environmental Science (major) and Public Health (minor) from the Asian University for women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and a M.Sc. in Forestry, with a specialization in hydrology from the Southern Illinois University Carbondale. I also have a Graduate Certificate in Business Intelligence from the Colorado State University. Before starting my Ph.D. program, I worked in two research positions investigating natural resource use patterns and assessing the impacts of anthropogenic activities ranging from surface coal mining in Eastern Kentucky to military training lands in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. 

My experience in spatial data science comes mostly from research work starting with my master's research and then working as a research assistant at two different universities. I particularly work with spatial data and its analysis for resource management mainly focused on forest resources. In my research work, I have worked primarily with data collected from the field through household surveys and field equipment for environmental measurements and remotely collected data such as satellite images or data collected using drones. I am a visual person, so I enjoy working on data visualization, particularly creating maps, in which I can use both my analytical and creative skills to present data and research findings to both academic and non-academic audiences. I also enjoy the logical and problem-solving aspects of data science and analytics which involves addressing complex problems or answering research questions and generating meaningful insights
